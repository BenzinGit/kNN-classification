# kNN-classification

A python program calculates unknown objects with a simple machine learning algorithm. It mainly uses numpy for the calculations and matplotlib.pyplot to visualize the results.
The program lets the user choose 3 different options.

1. The program lets the user classify an unknown object by generating training data.
2. The program measures the precision of the kNN-algorithm my letting the user enter three file names. (See data_files)
3. The program exits

The program was at first written in Swedish and then translated to English, which is the main reason why the documentation is so concise.
